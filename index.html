            <h1>Tea Manufacturing Company</h1>
            <img src="./main__image.jpg" alt="main__img">
            <p>The journey of the esteemed DPD Group started with a dream. Shri Dwarka Prasad Desai (DPD) migrated to
                Assam from Village Hansi (Haryana) in the year 1948 with a dream of making a mark in the country.</p>

            <p>Within a few years, in the early 1960s, through his sheer hard work and a resilient spirit, he set up a
                timber saw mill which later resulted in setting up of a factory to manufacture plywood and veneer. It
                was then, that the thriving tea business of the region caught his attention. Soon, he started buying
                small plots of land began planting tea.This was the start of the Group, as we know it today.</p>

            <p>The timber business had gathered a majestic wind in it’s sail, but the ban on timber industry of the
                North East region by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India dealt a severe blow. However to a majestic
                vision, no change is unwelcome. So, the Group decided to focus on tea plantations instead and set up a
                CTC Black Tea manufacturing unit.</p>
            <p> In the year 1994, DPD Group realized the untapped potential of the area and introduced the concept of
                "Bought Leaf Factories" which was almost unheard of in the district.</p>
            <p>The Annual Crop of Green Leaf in the area (Tinsukia—Changlang Border) was only 2 million Kgs per annum
                (Made Tea around 0.42 million kgs). At that time there was abundant barren land and the community was
                still developing, economically. This idea gave the people of the region an opportunity to make use of
                their land for tea plantation under the Group's guidance and support.</p>
            <p>This move steadily changed the entire face of the region. The small tea owners, hereby, founded a ready
                market to sell their products. This led to the community thriving and therefore the tea business.</p>
